# e Approximation using Monte-Carlo methods

$e \approx 2.718$ is a famous constant in Mathematics. It appears elegently in many applications, from calculus to complex numbers and statistics. The traditional means of generating this constant is by taking the limit of the following iterative sequence:

$$ e = \lim_{n \to \inf}(1+\frac{1}{n})^n $$

$a^1 = e^2 -1$
