# e Approximation using Monte-Carlo methods

## Background

${\Huge e \approx 2.718}$ is a famous constant in Mathematics. It appears elegently in many applications, from calculus to complex numbers and statistics. The traditional means of generating this constant is by taking the limit of the following iterative sequence:

$$ \Large e = \lim_{n \to \infty}(1+\frac{1}{n})^n $$

There is a large volume of mathematical research in Monte-Carlo methods; which essentially solve mathematical/computational problems by using stochastic or random processes. Useful information can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method

As interesting as $\large e$ already is, it gets more interesting! It is possible to generate $\large e$ via a Monte-Carlo or stochastic method. The initial motivation for this project was obtained from the following StackExchange post:
