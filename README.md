## Background

<img src="/tex/ea58f7c7e035f339572ca09476e61916.svg?invert_in_darkmode&sanitize=true" align=middle width=67.01483084999998pt height=21.18721440000001pt/> is a famous constant in Mathematics. It appears elegently in many applications, from calculus to complex numbers and statistics. The traditional means of generating this constant is by taking the limit of the following iterative sequence:

There is a large volume of mathematical research in Monte-Carlo methods; which essentially solve mathematical/computational problems by using stochastic or random processes. Useful information can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method

As interesting as <img src="/tex/8cd34385ed61aca950a6b06d09fb50ac.svg?invert_in_darkmode&sanitize=true" align=middle width=7.654137149999991pt height=14.15524440000002pt/> already is, it gets more interesting! It is possible to generate <img src="/tex/8cd34385ed61aca950a6b06d09fb50ac.svg?invert_in_darkmode&sanitize=true" align=middle width=7.654137149999991pt height=14.15524440000002pt/> via a Monte-Carlo or stochastic method. The initial motivation for this project was obtained from the following StackExchange post:
